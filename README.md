# Gesture DJ Controller

A hand-controlled DJ interface with gesture controls, playlist management, and audio-reactive visualizations. Control your music with natural hand movements!

An interactive web application built with Three.js, MediaPipe computer vision, and Tone.js for real-time audio processing.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Control**: Use natural hand movements to control playback
  - **Left Hand**: Volume control (raise hand to increase volume)
  - **Right Hand**: Playback control
    - Pinch (thumb + index finger): Play/Pause
    - Raise hand high: Next track
    - Lower hand: Previous track
- **Playlist Management**: Import and organize your music collection
  - Import local audio files
  - Add tracks via URL
  - Drag and drop to reorder playlist
  - Remove unwanted tracks
- **Audio-Reactive Visualizer**: Real-time waveform visualization that responds to your music
- **Full-Screen Camera Overlay**: See your hands while controlling the music

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Camera access enabled for hand tracking
- Audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) or audio URLs for playback

## Technologies

- **MediaPipe** (@mediapipe/hands@0.4.1646424915) for hand tracking and gesture recognition
- **MediaPipe Camera Utils** (@mediapipe/camera_utils@0.3.1627447220) for camera integration
- **Three.js** for audio-reactive visual rendering and 3D graphics
- **Tone.js** for audio processing, effects, and analysis
- **HTML5 Canvas** for hand landmark visualization
- **JavaScript ES6 Modules** for modern, modular code architecture

## Setup for Development

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/collidingScopes/arpeggiator
cd arpeggiator

# Install dependencies (optional - project uses CDN imports)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

**Important**: The application requires camera access. Make sure to allow camera permissions when prompted.

## How to Use

1. **Allow Camera Access**: Grant camera permissions when prompted
2. **Import Music**: 
   - Click the ðŸŽµ button to open the sidebar
   - Use "Import Local Files" to add audio files from your computer
   - Or paste audio URLs to add online tracks
3. **Control with Gestures**:
   - Show your hands to the camera
   - Use left hand height to control volume
   - Use right hand gestures for playback control
4. **Manage Playlist**:
   - Click tracks to select them
   - Drag and drop to reorder
   - Use playback controls or gestures

## Gesture Controls

### Left Hand (Volume Control)
- **Raise hand**: Increase volume
- **Lower hand**: Decrease volume
- **Hand position**: Directly controls audio volume level

### Right Hand (Playback Control)
- **Pinch gesture** (thumb + index finger close): Play/Pause toggle
- **Raise hand high** (above 80% of screen): Skip to next track
- **Lower hand** (below 20% of screen): Go to previous track

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space**: Play/Pause
- **Arrow Right**: Next track
- **Arrow Left**: Previous track
- **M**: Toggle music sidebar
- **G**: Debug - Show gesture state in console
- **V**: Debug - Toggle video/canvas visibility

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js              # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ game.js              # Main game logic and MediaPipe integration
â”œâ”€â”€ MusicManager.js      # Audio playback and playlist management
â”œâ”€â”€ UIManager.js         # User interface and sidebar controls
â”œâ”€â”€ WaveformVisualizer.js # Audio-reactive visualization
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css           # Application styling
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Main HTML file
â””â”€â”€ assets/              # Static assets
    â””â”€â”€ siteOGImage.webp # Social media preview image
```

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari (with WebRTC support)
- Edge

**Note**: MediaPipe works best in Chrome/Chromium browsers. Some features may be limited in other browsers.

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Try refreshing the page and allowing permissions again

### Gesture Recognition Issues
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep hands visible and within camera frame
- Check browser console (F12) for debug information
- Use keyboard shortcut 'G' to view gesture state

### Audio Issues
- Ensure audio files are in supported formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- Check browser audio permissions
- Verify audio URLs are accessible and CORS-enabled
