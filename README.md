# Hand Gesture Arpeggiator

Hand-controlled arpeggiator, drum machine, and audio reactive visualizer. Raise your hands to raise the roof!

An interactive web app built with threejs, mediapipe computer vision, rosebud AI, and tone.js.

- Hand #1 controls the arpeggios (raise hand to raise pitch, pinch to change volume)
- Hand #2 controls the drums (raise different fingers to change the pattern)
