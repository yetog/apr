# Hand Gesture Arpeggiator

Hand-controlled arpeggiator, drum machine, and audio reactive visualizer. Raise your hands to raise the roof!

An interactive web app built with threejs, mediapipe computer vision, rosebud AI, and tone.js.

- Hand #1 controls the arpeggios (raise hand to raise pitch, pinch to change volume)
- Hand #2 controls the drums (raise different fingers to change the pattern)

My name is Alan, and I enjoy building open source software for computer vision, games, and more. This would be much appreciated during late-night coding sessions!
